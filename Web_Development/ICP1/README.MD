This is ICP1 where we have demonstrated the use of GitHub and Webstrom IDE.
In github we have created a repository for web development course and created the web and mobile folders.
In the web folder we created the ICP1 folder which we currently are in.
It has the source code folder where the index.html file has been pushed from the local repository.
In the documentation we have added the .pdf file explaining the ICP and also few screenshots.
Finally in the ICP1 we have pulled the repository and forked it coupled with issues request.
Finally we have forked an existing repository.
